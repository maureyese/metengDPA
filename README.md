# Metabolic Engineering for DPAHelix project

This repository corresponds to one of the five computational biology analyses of the DPAHelix project in the GOGEC Competition of 2026.

> **Objective**: Optimize the production of DPA through metabolic engineering.

We worked our model using notebooks from Google Colab (https://colab.research.google.com/). Important updates to our code were later added to this repository.

## Activity 1: Simulation of precursor production under normal conditions

We analyzed the production of x (most important precursor of DPA biosynthesis) under normal conditions in _B. subtilis_.

We downloaded the model...

We set our key metabolic path to produce PHA...

We set conditions...

(TODO: Finish writing)

## Activity 2
